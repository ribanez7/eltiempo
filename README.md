# Eltiempo

Before checking the api client, I thought that week predictions should take from monday to sunday of the current week. That's why I focused on how to deal with the proper dates, using active_support date utils and passing start and until dates. After that, I realised that the api we are using doesn't allow this kind of operations, and that for the week predictions you have to think on today plus 7 days. So from commit 0e961dc, anything has been reduced to the only possible actions we get from tiempo.com.
